## Project description
It is a landing page for a dental clinic. The websiteâ€™s main goal through the four main pages
is to show the available services that the clinic offers and show how professional its doctors 
are. The patient or visitor can request an appointment by entering his data and 
contact information which is required for further connection and confirming 
the registration. A bonus is added that checks if the user is smiling using 
Artificial intelligence to be redirected to the appointment request page, and 
that is an optional step that user can skip.
